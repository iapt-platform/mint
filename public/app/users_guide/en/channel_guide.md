## What is channel?

While we learning or translating some certain part of pāḷi text, we need to write down something, EX: translation, class note, commentaries, etc.
we need to mark two properties of these appended text - **language** & **type**
this we call **channel**.

By the channel function, we can realize the **multi-language** and **multi-type**, EX: 
- grammatical translation
- commentaries
- speech text
- 巴利直译

These **channels** will be display in such way:
>name-language@nickname

>grammatical translation-en@Bhikkhu Kosalla

There must be some other usage to be developed by the smart users like you.
