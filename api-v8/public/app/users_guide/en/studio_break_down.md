## Split method
Pali language segmentation is an important means of semantic analysis starting from etymology.

Users can decide to dismantle the words to what extent they wish.

If the plus sign "+" to separate each component, the machine will automatically identify and find the respective components.

If the word is tonal (sandhi) it can be further disassembled and analyzed separately.

If you are not sure how to split, there are several channels to choose from:
- Word query by clicking
  - Click on a word, Opening the <svg id="icon_dict" viewBox="0 0 32 32" style='fill:#6baaff;height: 10px; width: 15px;'><g transform="translate(-4 -4)"><path class="a" d="M24.4,2,17.9,7.85v14.3l6.5-5.85V2M8.15,5.9A12.09,12.09,0,0,0,1,7.85V26.908a.7.7,0,0,0,.65.65c.13,0,.195-.091.325-.091A15.85,15.85,0,0,1,8.15,26.05,12.09,12.09,0,0,1,15.3,28a15.659,15.659,0,0,1,7.15-1.95,13.241,13.241,0,0,1,6.175,1.378.565.565,0,0,0,.325.039.7.7,0,0,0,.65-.65V7.85A8.867,8.867,0,0,0,27,6.55V24.1a15.106,15.106,0,0,0-4.55-.65A15.659,15.659,0,0,0,15.3,25.4V7.85A12.09,12.09,0,0,0,8.15,5.9Z" transform="translate(5 4)"></path></g></svg> in the upper right corner will display dictionary lookup results.
